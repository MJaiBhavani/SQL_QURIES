# SQL_QURIES

### Objective:

Conducted an in-depth analysis of web traffic data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to website usage, visitor behavior, and performance metrics.
Used SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to explore, clean, and analyze the raw web traffic data.

### Data Overview:

The dataset includes information on website visits, user sessions, page views, traffic sources, devices, geographic locations, and time-based metrics.
Key columns included: timestamp, session_id, page_Views_per_session,duration, source_type , device_type, browser_type, location and Content segment 

Key Steps in the EDA Process:

### Data Cleaning: 

Identified and removed duplicates, missing values, and outliers that could distort analysis.
Data Transformation: Converted raw timestamps into usable time-based formats (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly aggregates).
Data Aggregation: Aggregated traffic data by various dimensions (e.g., time, location, device type, referral source) to uncover high-level trends.
Key SQL Queries & Techniques:

### Basic Filtering & Aggregation:

Filtered traffic data based on specific time ranges, device types, or locations.
Used GROUP BY and COUNT to aggregate data (e.g., page views per day, count of sessions  per month).
Time-Based Analysis:
Identified peak traffic based on week of days  and monthly trends using Dayofweek() and month() functions in SQL.
Analyzed session duration and engagement over time using SUM() functions.
### Traffic Source Analysis:
Investigated traffic sources (e.g., email, social media, refferal ) using JOIN and GROUP BY to understand how users were finding the website.
### User Segmentation:
Segmented visitors based on device type, geographic location, 

### Key Insights Gained:

Identified peak traffic times and high-engagement periods (e.g. weekdays, month).
Uncovered trends in traffic sources: refferal , social ,email  and others traffic showed higher conversion rates compared to social media referrals.
Device Usage Trends: Tablet users had higher duration rate  than desktop users and moblie, indicating potential issues with mobile site performance.
Geographical Insights: Certain regions showed higher traffic and engagement, suggesting a targeted marketing opportunity for those locations.
Discovered opportunities to optimize the websiteâ€™s performance by reducing bounce rates and improving page load times for specific pages and devices.

### Tools & Technologies:

MySQL Workbench for querying and analyzing data in a MySQL database.
SQL functions used: SELECT, GROUP BY, JOIN, WHERE, HAVING, COUNT(), AVG(), SUM(), DATE(), ORDER BY, etc.
